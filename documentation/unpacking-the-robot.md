# Unpacking the Robot

## The Cases

Ratchet (#67) is in the case without casters. Clank (#68) is in the case with casters. Both cases can be unlocked with a three digit code. Please see Professor Perry for the code. The numbers on the locks must be aligned with the arrows on the side, then the button can be pressed to release the cable. Keep the lock attached to the case.

Keep all parts in each case with that robot; The parts are unique to each of them.

## Unpacking Process

Two people are required to unpack the robot.

1. Unlock and open the case

3. Slowly bend the knees and bring the feet flat onto the backboard

5. Lift the robot out of the case using the rope at the head and feet
6. Carefully lower the robot onto the floor
7. Slide the backboard out from under the robot
8. Grab the robot by the handle between the shoulders and pivot the upper body forward

The robot should now be in a squatting position and is ready for the turn on sequence.
